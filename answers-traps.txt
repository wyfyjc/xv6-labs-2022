Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0-a7和fa0-f7寄存器包含函数的参数; 13被寄存器a2保存

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: 在main函数的汇编代码中，并没有调用f和g函数

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x0000000000000642

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38

Q: Run the following code.

	   unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	   printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
   What is the output? 
   The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change to a different value?
A: He110 World; 如果RISC-V是大端序，应该令i = 726c6400

Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after ? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	   printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A: y并未给定一个值，但是printf仍然会打印出寄存器中的数据，一个无意义的值
